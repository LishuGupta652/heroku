                        <p>
                            The school offers wide range of Post-Graduates programmes [M. Tech., MCA, M.Sc. (CS), M.Sc.
                            (IT) and MBA (CM)], Under-Graduate programme [BCA] and Diploma programme [PGDCA]. These
                            programmes provide appropriate specialization for students with a wide range of backgrounds
                            and career aspirations. These programmes are structured as flexible, modular and credit
                            based in curriculum to permit students to take the study with appropriate pace and choice.
                            Also, involving UG students in research is necessary. Therefore, a need has been felt to
                            design such a curriculum which gives enough flexibility and choice to the students as per
                            their capabilities and interest leading to increased employability.
